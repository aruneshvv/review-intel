- "Dyson V15" (brand + model)

**Less effective:**
- "headphones" (too generic)

- "ABC123XYZ" (model numbers alone may not find results)

### Check Multiple Products

Compare similar products to make informed decisions:
1. Analyze Product A
2. Note the score and concerns
3. Analyze Product B
4. Compare results

### Consider Context

- **High-ticket items**: More Reddit discussions, more reliable data
- **Niche products**: Fewer comments, check the sample size
- **New products**: May have limited reviews
